# awesomeBooks-with-Classes
I will refactor the Awesome books application to use JavaScript classes.
In this project, I will build a basic website that allows users to add/remove books from a list. I will achieve that by using JavaScript objects and arrays. I will also need to dynamically modify the DOM and add basic events.
The purpose of this repository is practicing JavaScript Object Oriented Programming.

- Use ES6 modules to write modular JavaScript.
- Learn how to use proper ES6 syntax.
- Understand improvements that ES6 brings to JavaScript.
- Use npm as software packages system.
